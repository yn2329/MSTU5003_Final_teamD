Link to our finaly project: https://codepen.io/yn2329/pen/mKjZjW

we plan to start a MOOC Web page, but it takes the effort to complete a  full set. Therefore, we only present a prototype here. Start from the beginning, and we are trying to set up a time and date for all users to see, that makes the webpage more up-to date. 
Under the title and the date, we have a button of Sign in, and the function opens to either the newcomer or the previous user. Within the same section, we have three options for cancel, log in, and register. Log in option requires both email and password, lacking either will result an alert sign for the users.  the users with the email and password will be directed to a new page called course list; which basically is the course planner with the function of add-on or scratch off for the courses that are chosen by students. 
as for the register button, it mainly equipped with a similar function as the login session, but with one more input requirement of repeat password. Again, all the input section requires the user to put in sth which will enable them to further the registration procedure. for now, we haven't really wrapped up everything. Therefore, we set up a web page called coming soon with a countdown timer so that the user can expect something. 
under the sign in section, the slideshow is mainly presenting the favorite courses that offered by the website, and each page is equipped with a click button to proceed with further detailed information.
